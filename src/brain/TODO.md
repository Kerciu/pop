- Loading gifts: nearest FROM BASE -> nearest from base, nearest to the loaded one etc. -> route_planner adjustment
- You can accelerate by more than 1 -> motion_control adjustment
- Think about deciding which axle handle first (based on velocity, distance etc) -> motion_control adjustment
- Loading carrots (now hard-coded amount) -> smart_solver but needs to be separated to new module
